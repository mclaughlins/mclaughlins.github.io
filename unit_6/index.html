		<!-- Not sure about using this text yet. We specialize in the rich, sweet and delicious. Whenever possible we use the freshest locally produced or distributed ingredients in our products. We use top of the line gourmet ingredients in all our recipes. Our dairy supplier is the Challenge Dairy Cooperative, a cooperative of more than 600 California dairies. We try to minimize our environmental footprint by using compostable cups, clamshell boxes, utensils and straws. We also use paper bags and boxes whenever possible.

		Family owned and operated, Sugarland Bake Shop is committed to serving the finest baked goods available and providing unmatched customer service. We look forward serving you!-->
